## Option 1: Heroes of Pymoli

After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, I have landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. I have been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli. Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

My final report should include each of the following:

### Player Count

### Total Number of Players

### Purchasing Analysis (Total):

1. Number of Unique Items
2. Average Purchase Price
3. Total Number of Purchases
4. Total Revenue

### Gender Demographics:

1. Percentage and Count of Male Players
2. Percentage and Count of Female Players
3. Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed

### Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
The below each broken by gender:

1. Purchase Count
2. Average Purchase Price
3. Total Purchase Value
4. Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender

### Age Demographics
1. The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.):
- Purchase Count
- Average Purchase Price
- Total Purchase Value
- Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group

### Top Spenders
1. Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
- SN
- Purchase Count
- Average Purchase Price
- Total Purchase Value

### Most Popular Items
1. Identify the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a table):
- Item ID
- Item Name
- Purchase Count
- Item Price
- Total Purchase Value

### Most Profitable Items
1. Identify the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
- Item ID
- Item Name
- Purchase Count
- Item Price
- Total Purchase Value

### As final considerations:

1. I must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
2. I must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames.
3. I must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
